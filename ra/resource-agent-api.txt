1. Abstract

Resource Agents (RA) are the middle layer between the Resource Manager (RM)
and the actual resources being managed. They aim to integrate the resource
with the RM without any modifications to the actual resource provider itself,
by encapsulating it carefully and thus making it movable between real nodes
in a cluster.

The RAs are obviously very specific to the resource type they are
encapsulating, however there is no reason why they should be specific to a
particular RM.


1.1. Scope

This document documents a common API for the RM to call the RAs so the pool of
available RAs can be shared by the different clustering solutions.

It does NOT define any libraries or helper functions which RAs might share
with regard to common functionality like external command execution, cluster
logging et cetera, as these are NOT specific to RA and are defined in the
respective standards.


1.2. API version described

This document currently describes version 1.1 of the API. 


2. Terms used in this document

2.1. "Resource"

A single physical or logical entity that provides a service to clients or
other resources. For example, a resource can be a single disk volume, a
particular network address, or an application such as a web server. A resource
is generally available for use over time on two or more nodes in a cluster,
although it usually can be allocated to only one node at any given time.

Resources are identified by the combination of their type and name. The name
is a special case of an instance parameter; the name/resource type combination
is required to be unique in the cluster.

A resource may also have instance parameters which provide additional
information required for Resource Agent to control the resource.

A resource may have dependencies on other resources or capabilities provided
by other resources. Common examples include a dependency on an IP address
being configured or a file system being mounted. These are special cases of
instance parameters and are treated in much the same fashion.


2.2. "Resource types"

A resource type represents a set of resources which share a common set of
instance parameters and a common set of actions which can be performed on it.


2.3. "Resource agent"

A RA provides the actions ("member functions") for a a given type of
resources; by providing the RA with the instance parameters, it is used to
control a specific resource.

They are usually implemented as shell scripts, but the API described here does
not require this.

Although this is somewhat similar to SystemV init scripts as described by the
LSB, there are some differences explained below. 


2.4. "Instance parameters"

Instance parameters are the attributes which uniquely identify a given
resource instance. It is recommended that the set of instance parameters for
any given type of resources to be as minimal as possible.

An instance parameter has a given name and value. They are both case sensitive
and must satisfy the requirements of POSIX environment name/value
combinations.


2.5. "Resource group"

This is a term from the RM world, but it is explained in brief here for
completeness. As explained above, a complex resource commonly has dependencies
on other resources required for proper operation; all dependencies required to
provide an actual service to the user are usually grouped into a "resource
group" which is handled as an atomic unit by the cluster, as it isn't possible
to move a resource without also moving its dependencies or only moving a
resource but not the resources which depend on it.

While the resource grouping is still commonly implemented by manual
configuration, the information provided by the RAs should be sufficient for
the RM to build the dependency tree on its own as far as possible.


3. API

3.1. API versioning

The version number is of the form "x.y", where x and y are positive integer
numbers. x is referred to as the "major" number, and y the "minor" number.

The major number must be increased if a _not downwards compatible_ change is
made to the API. A major number mismatch between the RA and the RM must be
reported as an error to the administrator.

The minor number must be increased if _any_ change at all is made to the API.
If the major is increased, the minor number is reset to 1. The minor number
can be used by both sides to see whether a certain additional feature is
supported by the other party.


3.2. Paths

The RM locates the OCF compliant RA for a specific resource type by looking
for the meta data file in /usr/ocf/resource.d/<ResourceType>.xml; the contents
of this file are explained in section 4.

This file includes a pointer to the executable of the RA which the RM will
call.



3.3. Execution syntax

After the RM has identified the executable to call, it will be called in the
following format:

	/path/to/RA <action> <Resource name>


3.4. Resource Agent actions

A RA must be able to perform the following actions on a given resource on
request by the RM; additional actions may be supported by the script for
example for LSB compliance, however more actions may be officially defined in
the future.

In general, a RA should not assume it is the only RA of its type running
because the RM might start several RA instances for multiple independent
resource instances in parallel.


- start

  This brings the resource online and makes it available for use. It should
  NOT terminate before the resource has been fully started.

  It may try to implement recover actions for certain cases of startup
  failures at its discretion to comply.
  
  "start" must succeed even if the resource instance is already running.
  
- stop

  This stops the resource. After the "stop" command has completed, nothing
  should remain active of the resource and it must be possible to start it
  on the same node or another node.
  
  Only if this cannot be guaranteed should it report failure; stopping an
  already stopped resource should succeed.
  
  The "stop" request by the RM includes the authorization to bring down the
  resource even by force as long data integrity is maintained; breaking
  currently active transactions should be avoided, but the request to offline
  the resource has higher precedence than this.

  The "stop" action should also perform clean-ups of artifacts like leftover
  shared memory segments, semaphores, IPC message queues, lock files etc.

- status

  Verifies whether a resource is working correctly. This should be
  "light-weight" query as it is called by the RM fairly often to poll the
  status of the resource.
 
  It is accepted practice to have additional instance parameters which are not
  strictly required to identify the resource instance but are needed to
  monitor it or customize of how intrusive this check is allowed to be.

  Note: An interface where the RA actively informs the RM of failures is
  planned but not defined yet.
  
- restart

  A special case of the "start" action, this should try to recover a resource
  locally. If this is not supported, the RA should simply return failure.

  The meta-data query should reveal whether this action is supported or not.
  
  An example includes "recovering" an IP address by moving it to another
  interface; this is much less costly than initiating a full resource group
  fail over to another node.

- reload

  Reload the configuration file without breaking currently connected users.

  This is not a mandatory action; if it is supported, the RA should advertise
  this in the meta data, and if called by the RM anyway should return a "not
  implemented" error code.
  

3.5. Parameter passing

The instance parameters and some additional attributes are passed in via the
environment; this has been chosen because it does not reveal the parameters to
an unprivileged user on the same system and environment variables can be
easily accessed by all programming languages and shell scripts.


3.5.1. Syntax for instance parameters

They are directly converted to environment variables; the name is prefixed
with "OCF_RESKEY_".

The instance parameter "force" with the value "yes" thus becomes:
	OCF_RESKEY_force=yes
in the environment.

See section 4. for a more formal explanation of instance parameters.


3.5.2. Special parameters

The entire environment variable name space starting with OCF_ is considered to
be reserved. 

Currently, the following additional parameters are defined:

OCF_RA_VERSION_MAJ
OCF_RA_VERSION_MIN
	Version number of the OCF Resource Agent API. If the script does 
	not support this revision, it should report an error.
	
	See 3.1. for an explanation of the versioning scheme used. The version
	number is split into two numbers for ease of use in shell scripts.

	These two may be used by the RA to determine whether it is run under
	an OCF compliant RM.
	
	Example: OCF_RA_VERSION_MAJ=1
		 OCF_RA_VERSION_MIN=1

OCF_ROOT
	Referring to the root of the OCF directory hierarchy.
	
	Example: OCF_ROOT=/usr/ocf


3.6. Exit codes

These exit codes were largely modeled after the LSB 1.1.0 spec for
compatibility.

NOTE: However, the ranges "reserved for application use" by the LSB may be
used by the OCF in the future to report more fine-grained status or special
cases to the RM.

3.6.1. "status"

0 	program is running or service is OK
1 	program is dead and /var/run pid file exists
2 	program is dead and /var/lock lock file exists
3 	program is stopped
4 	program or service status is unknown
5-99 	reserved for future LSB use
100-149 reserved for distribution use
150-199 reserved for application use
200-254 reserved

3.6.2. "start", "stop", "restart", "reload"

1 	generic or unspecified error (current practice)
2 	invalid or excess argument(s)
3 	unimplemented feature (for example, "reload")
4 	user had insufficient privilege
5 	program is not installed
6 	program is not configured
7 	program is not running
8-99 	reserved for future LSB use
100-149 reserved for distribution use
150-199 reserved for application use
200-254 reserved


4. Relation to the LSB

It is required that the current LSB spec is fully supported by the system.

The API tries to make it possible to have RA function both as a normal LSB
init script and a cluster-aware RA, but this is not required functionality.
The RAs could however use the helper functions defined for LSB init scripts.

If a RA is both OCF and LSB compliant, it may reside under /etc/init.d; please
refer to http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.1.0/gLSB/sysinit.html
for more details on LSB compliance.
	
However, it is still required that the meta data file be installed in
/usr/ocf/resource.d/; the RM should not simply try to call a init.d script
with OCF syntax.


5. RA meta data

5.1. Format

We have the following requirements which are not fulfilled by the LSB way of
embedding meta data into the beginning of the init scripts:

- Independent of the language the RA is actually written in,
- Extensible,
- Structured,
- Easy to parse from a variety of languages.

This is why we use simple XML to describe the RA meta data. The DTD for this
API can be found at http://www.opencf.org/standards/ra-api-1.dtd.


5.2. Location of the meta data

The met data file for a given resource type is stored in

	/usr/ocf/resource.d/<ResourceType>.xml


5.3. Semantics

An example of a valid meta data file is provided in ra-metadata-example.xml .
