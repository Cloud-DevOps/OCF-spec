<parameter name="Device">
<longdesc>
When mounting a filesystem on a specific mountpoint, you have to specify which
device should be mounted; this will usually be similiar to /dev/sda1 or
/dev/volumegroup/logicalvolume when using LVM.
</longdesc>
<shortdesc>Device to be mounted</shortdesc>

<!-- This is a dependency on a "Blockdevice" resource; instead of specifying
     the Device manually, the adminstrator could set the dependency and the
     RM would provide the resource name of the dependency as the parameter
     value. -->

</parameter>

<parameter name="FSType">
<longdesc>
You should chose a journaled filesystem for the shared storage to ensure that
the filesystem remains consistent and that it can be mounted without an
expensive fsck run; recommendations include reiserfs, ext3 and XFS.

<parameter name="mount_options">
<longdesc>
The mount options used for mounting a filesystem; normally this is set to
defaults, but you may want to modify this if you require a read-only
mount or something similar.
